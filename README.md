Library project via The Odin Project

1/9/2024: Today I am expanding on the example code (a simple book constructor I wrote). The end product will be a app with options to add books to the library with user input, remove books, and mark them as read/unread.
There are plenty of bugs to work out, but currently the app logs the read status and Book info in the console. The new book button doesn't trigger the new book form when triggered yet and the myLibrary info for each book doesn't populate the book cards yet unless I target one specific Book object, which is not what I need to do. To be continued...
